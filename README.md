# Nonlinear-least-squares-material-modeling
I implement gradient descent on NLLS in a problem of physical modeling of materials. Specifically, I estimate parameters for expansion of copper as a function of temperature using a real dataset.
I also :
1)Set up a nonlinear least squares as an unconstrained optimization function
2)Compute initial parameter estimates for a simple rational model
3)Compute the gradients of the least squares objective
4)Implement gradient descent for minimizing the objective
5)Implement momentum gradient descent
6)Visualize the convergence of the algorithm
