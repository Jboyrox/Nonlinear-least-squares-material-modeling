# Nonlinear-least-squares-material-modeling
I implement gradient descent on NLLS in a problem of physical modeling of materials. Specifically, I estimate parameters for expansion of copper as a function of temperature using a real dataset.<br /> 
I also :<br /> 
1)Set up a nonlinear least squares as an unconstrained optimization function<br /> 
2)Compute initial parameter estimates for a simple rational model<br /> 
3)Compute the gradients of the least squares objective<br /> 
4)Implement gradient descent for minimizing the objective<br /> 
5)Implement momentum gradient descent<br /> 
6)Visualize the convergence of the algorithm<br /> 
The results of this experiment are present in the notebook nlls.ipynb
